		<h1>All About Kenneth</h1>

		<h3>Stuff</h3>
			<p>The few hobbies that I have include playing drums, guitar, and drawing sometimes. Recently I've gotten a sudden interest in bass guitar despite not actually owning one, but I like to play along to my favorite songs on the any of the instruments just listed. I'm pretty close to my family, my parents have been happily married for like 18 years now and my brothers often argue but make up by the end of the day.👀🏃🌚❗️😜</p>
		<h3>Technology</h3>
			<p>Like everyone else, I always have my phone with me and I use it quite a bit everyday. Whether it be to call or just binge watch any show I feel like, it's right there with me. Also use my laptop whenever I have homework on google drive that's due the next day. Not sure if electronic drums count as a piece of technology, but I use it everyday too. It's fun to play and it's a really good stress reliever.</p>
		<h3>Two Truths and a Lie</h3>
			<p>Below there are three statements about myself. Two of them are true and one of them is not, as the title suggests. Try and find out which one is the lie and which are true.(Pretty sure the answer's obvious)</p>
				<li>I can bend my thumb backwards</li>
				<li>I really like music</li>
				<li>The skin on my nose is clear</li>
		<h3>Five Favorite Nirvana Songs</h3>
			<p>I would consider myself a pretty casual Nirvana fan. I've listened to all three studio albums and a few songs of off Incesticide and such. Below are five of my favorite songs from them in no particular order.</p>
				<li>Heart-Shaped Box</li>
				<li>Aneurysm (Live at Paramount is better than studio tbh)</li>
				<li>Rape Me</li>
				<li>Sliver</li>
				<li>Negative Creep</li>
			<p>5 spots is not enough tbh, I like a lot of their stuff.</p>
